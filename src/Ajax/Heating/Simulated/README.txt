/** @namespace Ajax::Heating::Simulated

The 'Simulated' namespace is the root name space for a primitive house simulator.
The House simulator is intended to provide 'just enough' feedback for
indoor temperature response - based on the equipment state and 'outdoor 
temperature' to provide feedback to the control algorithm (i.e. running closed
loop)
